# Decision Tree and Random Forest ML method.

`Decision Tree and Random Forest method can be relied on when it comes to predicting outcome given the certain dataset`

`The significant difference between these methods and the other methods like KNN, and logistic regression is in the use of feature scaling`

`When using decision tree or random forest method, there is no need to scale (normalize, or standardize) the data first as both of said methods is not using gradient descent`
